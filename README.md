# umdalecs doftiles repo

Here is where i save my dotfiles 
(a fancy way to call configuration files for unix systems).

---

I mainly manage this with the [*GNU stow*](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) package, 
so the folder structure for unix systems follows its conventions, 
if you are interested on how it is used follow the link i placed after.
